# Bug List
Current list of bugs on the radar and being investigated to be fixed:
1. ## Column View on Packlist
    Column view on pack list is currently not working (side by side list of all items with pack list for easy creation, comparison, etc)

# Wish List
Current list of desired features I am hoping to add to the application
1. ## Column app view
    I would like to have a side by side editing feature with the full searchable list of items next to the packlist
2. ## Pack templates
    Fast lists, like survival items or base items that should be included in every trip.
3. ## Smart lists
    AI Assisted packlist based on climate, altitude, and region for the trip intended.
4. ## Location Tracker
    Track your desired camping locations on a map interface. Ideally, would like to pull from Gaia, Google earth bookmarks, bing maps, or some service likely already in use by users
5. ## Smart location packing
    Trip information used to generate list of needed items based on geolocation reports for predicted weather, duration of stay, and style of camping
6. ## Types of trips
    Pack lists easily generated for different styles of trips (Car camping, tent camping, backpacking, etc)
